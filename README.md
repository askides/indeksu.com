# Indeksu

Team Up With Search Engines! Index Faster, Rank Higher.

## What is Indeksu?

Indeksu is a tool built using Remix to help you index your websites faster. Built in public and proudly open source.

## What is the goal of Indeksu?

The main goal of this app is to help developers to learn how to build a fully functional SaaS application using Remix and other modern tools. That's why i decided to build it in public and open source.

In addition, there will be also a hosted version of the app, for the people that want to use it without having to install it on their own servers, and also to help me to pay the bills. ðŸ˜„

## Current Status

At the moment, Indeksu is in its early stages. We are working on the first version of the tool and we are looking for feedback from the community. Feel free to jump in and help us shape the future of Indeksu.

## How can I help?

First in first, give me a star, and share this project with your friends that want to learn how to build a SaaS application using Remix. Also, feel free to open issues and pull requests to help us improve the app.
